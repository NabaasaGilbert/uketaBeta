        "Rosemary, Personal Development Course Graduate & HER Group Member": "The Her Group awoke a fire within me at a time when the world was locked away with uncertainty. The content of the units is amazing with topics on professional, personal and life skills. The courses have reminded me of the importance of being visible and speaking up in different contexts to bring about the positive changes I would like to see. I am more intentional regarding the goals and targets I would like to achieve for the business each month. With strategic focus, hard work, resilience, networking and commitment, I have seen an increase in sales, excellent customer reviews and overall profitability. Nataliey is generous with her time, knowledge and skills which she shares freely and is open to offering her expertise when ladies reach out."
